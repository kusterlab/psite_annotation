        Group delocalized phospho-forms and aggregate their quantitative values.

        This function identifies peptide sequences that differ only by the position
        of their phosphorylation (`(ph)`) group and collapses them into
        "delocalized" groups. Each group contains all modified sequence variants
        that represent the same underlying peptide backbone.

        The following columns are added to the dataframe:

        - 'Modified sequence representative' = A single representative sequence
        selected from the group, i.e. the most frequently measured across experiments.
        - 'Modified sequence representative degree' = Fraction of summed observation
        frequency contributed by the representative peptide.

        All experiment columns (e.g. `"Experiment 1"`, `"Experiment 2"`, â€¦) are aggregated
        per group by summing the intensities of member sequences.

        Args:
            df: Input dataframe with:
                - `"Modified sequence"` column containing peptide strings with `(ph)` annotations
                - 'Delocalized sequence' = Canonical unmodified backbone with an index
                suffix to distinguish the number of modifications.
                - 'Modified sequence group' = All peptide variants belonging to the same
                delocalized group, concatenated with semicolons.
